  <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
  <p>
    We expect everyone on GroupDate to treat each other respectfully, with kindness and compassion. We do not tolerate
    hateful, hurtful, or harassing content on GroupDate. &nbsp;We consider unsolicited sexual content and messages to be
    sexual harassment. <strong> We don't like jerks, so please don't be a jerk.&nbsp;</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's the thing. We want you to think about this one rule: treat online interactions as you would even if they
    were offline.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>When sending messages, consider what you would say to people who you just met at a club or coffee shop.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>When uploading photos, consider if the same pose or outfit would be appropriate with your friends.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>When creating a profile, consider if you'd feel comfortable having a friend reading it.&nbsp;
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    GroupDate is not a magical place where people want to hear about your sexual fantasies out of the blue, or where
    you can be mean to someone with no repercussions. Treat it as a place where you can talk to other humans about
    things that matter to them, and remember that the best way to make a meaningful connections with people is to
    treat them well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Below are our community guidelines and moderation standards. If you see anyone who violates these
    guidelines, please report them to us right away.

  <h3 id="harassing">Harassment</h3>

  <p>
    If you wouldn’t say it to someone you just met in person, you shouldn’t be saying it online. Messages should be
    respectful, appropriate, honest, and kind. We don't tolerate "negging" (insulting statements disguised as
    "flirting") or other rude behavior. This expectation also includes interactions with GroupDate staff. People found
    to be sending harassing messages will be banned.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, profile content itself should also be respectful and kind.
  </p>

  <h3 id="sexual">Sexual Harassment / Explicit Sexual Content</h3>

  <p>
    Exposing other people to your sexual fantasies without their consent is rude and inappropriate, and it's not what
    most people on GroupDate are looking for. If your profile is reported to us as sexually explicit or offensive, it
    will be banned. This includes kink / fetish profiles, profiles describing which sex acts they are looking for, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    We also do not allow unwanted sexually explicit messages on GroupDate. This includes descriptions of sexual
    acts / kinks/ fetishes, sexualized comments about people's photos, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, "artistic" nudity is allowed but we do not allow porn (i.e.: Closeup photo of genitals).
    We want to let you know this rule has a problem: What is artistic is subjective and that makes this rule dark,
    because it could be a potential wildcard for any level of censorship, we want you to know that this is not our idea,
    it's a rule imposed by Google and Apple. If any censorship with medieval style happens is not coming from us.
  </p>

  <h3 id="hate">Hate</h3>

  <p>
    We take the truth of everyone’s inalienable rights very seriously. Our belief in them has acted as our
    inspiration since our founding. We proudly stand rooted in inclusivity. There is no room for hate in a
    place where you’re looking for love.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any content (including in profiles and messages) that promotes or condones racism, bigotry, violence, hate,
    dehumanization, or harm against individuals or groups based on things like race, ethnicity, disability, age,
    nationality, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religion, appearance, or occupation/association with a
    group is strictly forbidden and may result in you being permanently banned. This includes but is not limited to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Symbols of hate groups in photos, racist or offensive memes, etc.</li>
    <li>Hateful slurs, offensive statements, coded language, dog whistles, or references to being a member of a hate
      group</li>
    <li>Giving approval (even tacit) or statements of support towards a hate group or their ideals</li>
    <li>It also includes your reports to GroupDate staff: if you flag a profile for no other reason than being trans,
      for example, it may result in your own profile being banned.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="violent">Violent or Graphic Content</h3>

  <p>
    We do not allow any content in photos, profiles, or messages that is threatening, incites violence, contains
    graphic or gratuitous violence or gore, or is disturbing or otherwise inappropriate for a dating site. This
    does also include depictions of self harm which can in turn be harmful for others to see. This content will be
    removed and may also get you banned.
  </p>

  <h3 id="names">Profile names and profile text</h3>

  <p>
    We consider your profile's display name and your profile text to be similar to a first message or first
    impression to other members of the site: we expect both to be respectful. If your profile text or name
    could be seen as offensive or hateful we will take moderation action, up to and including banning your
    profile.
    <br /><br />
    Your listed name should be the name you like to go by. It can be your first name, your initials, or a nickname - all
    are fine. It does not have to be the full name. We do not check listed names against any kind of ID, and we trust
    people to enter names they'd like to go by themselves. That said, we will still moderate based on names if they
    include offensive language, or make a profile appear to be fake (i.e. using a celebrity name instead of your own).
  </p>

  <h3 id="unique">Unique and bona fide profile</h3>

  <p>
    You must create only one unique profile. In addition, your use of GroupDate must be for bona fide
    relationship-seeking purposes (for example, you may not use GroupDate solely to compile a report of compatible
    singles in your area, to find people to join a club, or to write a school research paper).
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, deleting and re-creating your account to get around other member's Passes or Blocks of you is not
    acceptable. If we see excessive and suspicious account deletion activity we may ban your profile.
  </p>

  <h3 id="fake">Fake Accounts</h3>

  <p>
    We do not tolerate any kind of fake accounts on GroupDate. Your profile must be really of you, and must be for
    dating purposes.
  </p>

  <h3 id="solicitation">Solicitation</h3>

  <p>
    Using GroupDate for commercial solicitation or exchange of money is prohibited. Do not share your own financial
    information (PayPal, Onlyfans, Venmo, Amazon wishlist, etc.) for the purpose of receiving money or goods from
    other members. Do not attempt to get other member's financial or other private information.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do not send messages or create accounts for the purpose of driving members to a business or external site. This
    includes recruiting people for a hobby or activity if it's not for dating purposes. Adding a link to an
    external site that redirects to a pay-site is not a clever way of skirting our solicitation rules, we will spot
    it. <br /> <br /> We also do not allow references to sugar daddy / baby dating, asking for gifts to date, etc, or
    phrases like "Send me $5 and see what happens" on your profile. This all falls under solicitation of money / goods
    and is not allowed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Likewise, we also do not allow offers of money for sex, sugar daddies, acceptance of solicitation offers,
    etc.
  </p>
  <p>Doing any of these will get you banned.</p>

  <h3 id="contact">Contact information</h3>

  <p>
    We do not allow anyone to post private information for public display, including their own private
    information, but especially other people's. Violations of other people's privacy will result in a ban.
  </p>

  <h3 id="illegal">Illegal behavior</h3>

  <p>
    It should go without saying, but discussion or promotion of anything illegal is not allowed and will result in
    getting you banned. This includes illegal sexual acts, drug dealing, fraud, threats, or anything else that is
    against the law. We do not tolerate any kind of discussion about underage sex, including dd/lg fantasies.
  </p>

  <h3 id="minors">Minors / under 18</h3>

  <p>
    You must be 18 to use GroupDate. We do not allow minors to use GroupDate. Although all profiles only allow you
    to enter an age over 18, sometimes people will lie about their age. If you suspect a profile of being made by
    someone who is under 18, please report them to us. <br /><br /> If we find someone to be knowingly engaging in
    inappropriate conversation with someone who has revealed themselves to be under 18, we will also ban that
    profile.
  </p>

  <h3 id="photos">Photos</h3>

  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>Photos should include your face (profile photo album), or be pictures you've taken (elsewhere).</li>
    <li>We do not allow photos involving weapons, someone carrying a weapon or similar. Although there are some
      countries where this is legal and common or you may be authorized to carry weapons (i.e: police), we don't
      have any exception for this, in the context of dating any weapon image is a very serious message of violence.</li>
    <li>We also do not allow any hateful imagery (white power / nazi images, racist meme photos, etc). This will get
      you banned. Any photos of anything overly violent, offensive, illegal, disturbing, or otherwise inappropriate
      for a dating site will be removed and may also get you banned.</li>
    <li>Photos with contact information on them (including phone number, email address, kik, Facebook address, etc)
      will be removed. Repeated violation of this rule or other suspicious behavior may result in the profile being
      blocked as well.</li>
    <li>Photos of you as a kid, or of your kids but without you in the photo as well will be removed.</li>
    <li>Finally, we will remove any image where the copyright holder has asked to have it removed, or where we
      strongly suspect the user is not the copyright holder (e.g., stock photos).</li>
    <li>For multiple offenses or extreme cases, profiles may also be banned and removed.</li>
    <li>Photos including artistic nudity are allowed but nudity with porn style (e.g., Closeup of the genitals) will be
      removed. We know this can be very subjective in most cases, it's a rule imposed by Google and Apple.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If a photo is removed you will be emailed and told that this has happened and warned that repeated offenses might
    get you banned.
  </p>

  <h3 id="offsite">Offsite behavior</h3>

  <p>
    We do ban for extreme offsite behavior. Please report any instances of offsite abuse, assault, harassment,
    stalking, theft, or anything else illegal or that makes you feel unsafe. (Note: we will not tell the person you're
    reporting to us that you have reported them or why they were reported).
  </p>
  <p>
    In these cases, we encourage you to reach out to law enforcement as well, who we will cooperate with where
    needed.
  </p>

  <h3 id="reporting">Reporting</h3>

  <p> Please help us by reporting anything or anyone that does not follow our community guidelines.</p>
  <p> You can report a profile by clicking the three dots icon to bring up a report button.</p>

  <strong>A note on false reporting</strong>
  <p>
    In some cases we will ban an account if we've found it to be creating false reports against other users.
    This includes flagging / reporting trans or non-binary users for no reason other than their gender or orientation,
    false / made up reports of bad behavior, etc.
