      This Privacy Policy is a copy of the famous app OkCupid's privacy policy with small changes. It's the same kind of
      application, so the legal documents can be the same.

   <strong>OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU</strong>
   <p>
      At GroupDate, your privacy is a top priority, we are more ethical in general because we don't make money and we
      are interested in money only if that allows us to cover costs, most unethical behaviors in companies are simply
      related with profit: CEOs that want luxury and power, investors demanding profits, etc. We don't like that life
      style, we are just like you because we built this to be users, you can fully trust us and focus on building
      meaningful group relationships, but we are transparent in general so you don't have to trust us, you can read this
      document.

      Because we use many of the same online services you do, we know that insufficient information and overly
      complicated language are common issues in privacy policies. We take the exact opposite approach: we’re doing our
      best to write our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language. We actually want you to read our
      policies and understand our privacy practices!

      Our commitment to security. We have teams dedicated to keeping your data safe and secure. We constantly update our
      security practices and invest in our security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.
   </p>
   <strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>
   <p>
      Welcome to GroupDate’s Privacy Policy. Thank you for taking the time to read it.

      We appreciate that you trust us with your information and we intend to always keep that trust. This starts with
      making sure you understand the information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used and your choices
      regarding your information. This Policy describes our privacy practices in plain language, keeping legal and
      technical jargon to a minimum.

      This Privacy Policy applies from March 28, 2022. The previous version of this Privacy Policy, available here,
      applies until then.

   <strong id="1">1. WHO WE ARE</strong>
   <p>
      We are not a company yet, just a bunch of developers, designers, and professionals from different fields
      collaborating together. The project leader is Fernando Medina. You can contact him by email at:
      poly.app.team@gmail.com
   </p>
   <strong id="2">2. WHERE THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLIES</strong>
   <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services we operate under the brand GroupDate,
      managed by Fernando Medina. For simplicity, we refer to all of these as our “services” in this Privacy Policy. To
      make it extra clear, we’ve added links to this Privacy Policy on all applicable services.

      The source code of the project has been shared to many people, this means new versions of this project will come
      in different countries in the near future, this Privacy Policy applies to the original GroupDate app only, not to
      forks or copies of it managed by other developers in the future.
   </p>
   <strong id="3">3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>
   <p>
      It goes without saying, we can’t help you develop meaningful connections without some information about you, such
      as basic profile details and the types of people you’d like to meet. We also collect information about your use of
      our services such as access logs, as well as information from third parties, like when you access our services
      through your social media account or when you upload information from your social media account to complete your
      profile. If you want additional info, we go into more detail below.

      You choose to give us certain information when using our services. This includes:

      When you create an account, you provide us with at least your login credential which is your email address, as
      well as some basic details necessary for the service to work, such as your gender and date of birth.
      When you complete your profile, you can share with us additional information, such as details on your personality,
      lifestyle, interests and other details about you, as well as content such as photos. To add certain content, like
      pictures, you may allow us to access your camera or photo album.
      If you contact us (for example, through our customer care team or on social media), we may collect the information
      you give us during the interaction.
      If you share with us information about other people (for example, if you use contact details of a friend for a
      given feature), we process this information on your behalf in order to complete your request.
      Of course, we also process your chats with other users as well as the content you publish, as necessary for the
      operation of the services.
      Information we receive from others

      In addition to the information you may provide us directly, we receive information about you from others,
      including:

      Users

      example, Facebook or Instagram).

      Other Partners
      We may receive information about you from our partners, for instance where GroupDate ads are published on a
      partner’s service (in which case they may pass along details on a campaign’s success). Where legally allowed, we
      can also receive information about suspected or convicted bad actors from third parties as part of our efforts to
      ensure our users’ safety and security.

      and interact with, when you exchanged with them, number of messages you send and receive).

      Device Information
      We collect information from and about the device(s) you use to access our services, including hardware and
      software information such as device ID and type, apps settings and characteristics and app crashes.

      u) Assist law enforcement

      To process your information as described in this Privacy Policy, we rely on the following legal bases:

      Provide our service to you: The reason we process your information for purposes A and B above is to perform the
      contract that you have with us. For instance, as you go about using our service to build meaningful connections,
      we use your information to maintain your account and your profile, make it viewable to other users and recommend
      other users to you and to otherwise provide our free and paid features.
      Legitimate interests: We process your information for purposes C, D and E above, based on our legitimate interest.
      For instance, we analyze users’ behavior on our services to continuously improve our offerings, we suggest offers
      we think might interest you and promote our own services, we process information to help keep our users safe and
      we process data where necessary to enforce our rights, assist law enforcement and enable us to defend ourselves in

      for us to comply with applicable laws and regulations and evidence our compliance with applicable laws and
      regulations. For example, we retain traffic data and data about transactions in line with our accounting, tax and
      other statutory data retention obligations and to be able to respond to valid access requests from law
      enforcement. We also keep data evidencing consents users give us and decisions they may have taken to opt-out of a
      given feature or processing.

      Consent: If you choose to provide us with information that may be considered “special” or “sensitive” in certain
      jurisdictions, such as your sexual orientation, you’re consenting to our processing of that information in
      accordance with this Privacy Policy. From time to time, we may ask for your consent to collect specific
      information, or use your information for certain specific reasons. In some cases, you may withdraw your consent by
      adapting your settings for instance where you entered information in your profile that may be considered “special”
      or “sensitive”, like you sexual orientation. In any case, you may withdraw your consent at any time by contacting
      us at the email address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.
   </p>
   <strong id="5">5. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION</strong>
   <p>
      Since our goal is to bring new ways of relationships to our culture, the main sharing of users’ information is, of
      course, with other users. We do not share your information with other companies or individuals unless we are
      required by law.

      With other users
      You share information with other users when you voluntarily disclose information on the service (including your
      public profile). Please be careful with your information and make sure that the content you share is stuff that
      you’re comfortable being visible.

      If you choose to limit the audience for all or part of your profile or for certain content or information about
      you, then it will be visible according to your settings.

      If someone submits a report involving you (such as a claim that you violated our Terms of Use or Community
      Guidelines), we may communicate to the reporter actions, if any, we took as a result of their report.

      We may transfer your information if we are involved, whether in whole or in part, in a merger, sale, acquisition,
      divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, bankruptcy or other change of ownership or control.

      With law enforcement / when required by law
      We may disclose your information if reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with a legal process, such as a court
      order, subpoena or search warrant, government / law enforcement investigation or other legal requirements; (ii) to
      assist in the prevention or detection of crime (subject in each case to applicable law); or (iii) to protect the
      safety of any person.

      To enforce legal rights
      We may also share information: (i) if disclosure would mitigate our liability in an actual or threatened lawsuit;
      (ii) as necessary to protect our legal rights and legal rights of our users, business partners or other interested
      parties; (iii) to enforce our agreements with you; or (iv) to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding
      illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing.

      With your consent or at your request
      We may ask for your consent to share your information with third parties. In any such case, we will make it clear
      why we want to share the information.
   </p>
   <strong id="6">6. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS</strong>
   <p>
      The sharing of information laid out in Section 6 involves cross-border data transfers to the United States of
      America and other jurisdictions that may have different laws about data processing. When we transfer personal
      information outside of the EEA, the United Kingdom, Switzerland or other countries, which data protection laws
      have been deemed adequate by the European Commission or other competent governmental body, we use standard
      contract clauses (standard contractual clauses are commitments between companies transferring personal data,
      binding them to protect the privacy and security of your data) or other appropriate transfer mechanism.
   </p>
   <strong id="7">7. YOUR RIGHTS</strong>
   <p>
      We want you to be in control of your information, so we want to remind you of the following options and tools
      available to you:

      Access / Update tools in the service. Tools and account settings can help you access, rectify or remove
      information that you provided to us and that’s associated with your account directly within the service. If you
      have any questions on those tools and settings, please contact us for help.
      Device permissions. Mobile platforms can have permission systems for specific types of device data and
      notifications, such as pictures, location services and push notifications. You can change your settings on your
      device to either consent or oppose the collection or processing of the corresponding information or the display of
      the corresponding notifications. Of course, if you do that, certain services may lose functionality.

      Uninstall. You can stop all information collection by an app by uninstalling it using the standard uninstall
      process for your device. Remember that uninstalling an app does NOT close your account. To close your account,
      please use the corresponding functionality on the service.

      Account deletion. You can delete your account by using the corresponding functionality directly on the service.
      We also want you to be aware of your privacy rights. Here are a few key points to remember:

      Reviewing your information. Applicable privacy laws may give you the right to review the personal information we
      keep about you (depending on the jurisdiction, this may be called right of access, right of portability, right to
      know or variations of those terms). You can exercise this right by putting in such a request here
      Updating your information. If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no
      longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion, object to or restrict its processing,
      please contact us here
      For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we
      can answer the above requests.

      Keep in mind, we may reject requests, including if we are unable to authenticate you, if the request is unlawful
      or invalid, or if it may infringe on trade secrets or intellectual property or the privacy or other rights of
      someone else. If you wish to receive information relating to another user, such as a copy of any messages you
      received from them through our service, the other user will have to contact us to submit a separate request for
      their information. We may also ask them to provide proof of identity before we can answer the request.

      Also, we may not be able to accommodate certain requests to object to or restrict the processing of personal
      information, notably where such requests would not allow us to provide our service to you anymore. For instance,
      we cannot provide our service if we do not have your date of birth and thus cannot ensure that you are 18 years of
      age or older.

      In certain countries, including in the EEA and the United Kingdom, you have a right to lodge a complaint with the
      appropriate data protection authority if you have concerns about how we process your personal information. You can
      find information about your data protection regulator in the EEA here, and in the United Kingdom here. The data
      protection authority you can lodge a complaint with may be that of your habitual residence, where you work or
      where an alleged infringement took place.
   </p>
   <strong id="8">8. HOW LONG WE RETAIN YOUR INFORMATION</strong>
   <p>
      We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes (as laid out in this
      document) and as permitted by applicable law. If you decide to stop using our services, you can delete your
      account and your information will be completely deleted in a way that not even us can recover it. Note that we
      will delete your account automatically if you are inactive for a period of two years.

      To protect the safety and security of our users, we implement a safety retention window of three months following
      account closure. During this period, we keep your information in the event that it might be necessary to
      investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of information during this safety retention window is
      based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims.

      Once the safety retention window elapses, we delete your data and only keep limited information for specified
      purposes, as laid out below:
      We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations: in particular, we keep transaction data
      to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements, We also keep records of consents users give us for five
      years to evidence our compliance with applicable law.
      We maintain limited information on the basis of our legitimate interest: we keep customer care records and
      supporting data as well as imprecise location of download / purchase(s) to support our customer care decisions,
      enforce our rights and enable us to defend ourselves in the event of a claim, profile data in anticipation of
      potential litigation, for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and data necessary to prevent
      users who were banned or people who were found to be under the age of 18 from opening a new account, to ensure the
      safety and vital interests of our users.
      Finally, we maintain information on the basis of our legitimate interest where there is an outstanding or
      potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep information, in particular if we receive a valid legal
      subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our
      legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings.
   </p>
   <strong id="9">9. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</strong>
   <p>
      Our services are restricted to individuals who are 18 years of age or older. We do not permit individuals under
      the age of 18 on our platform. If you suspect that a user is under the age of 18, please use the reporting
      mechanism available on the service.
   </p>
   <strong id="10">10. PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES</strong>
   <p>
      Because we’re always looking for new and innovative ways to help you build meaningful connections and strive to
      make sure explanations about our data practices remain up-to-date, this policy may change over time. We will
      notify you before any material changes take effect so that you have time to review the changes.
