   <p>
      It is important that you understand your rights and responsibilities with regard to the content on our Services,
      including any content you provide or post. You are expressly prohibited from posting inappropriate content.

      While using our Services, you will have access to: (i) content that you upload or provide while using our Services
      (“Your Content”); (ii) content that other users upload or provide while using our Services (“Member Content”); and
      (iii) content that GroupDate provides on and through our Services (“Our Content”). In this agreement, “content”
      includes, without limitation, all text, images, video, audio, or other material on our Services, including
      information on users’ profiles and in direct messages between users.

      <strong>3a. YOUR CONTENT</strong>
      You are responsible for Your Content. Don’t share anything that you wouldn’t want others to see, that would
      violate this Agreement, or that may expose you or us to legal liability.

      You are solely responsible and liable for Your Content, and, therefore, you agree to indemnify, defend, release,
      and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content.

      You represent and warrant to us that the information you provide to us or any other user is accurate, including
      any information submitted through Facebook or other third-party sources (if applicable), and that you will update
      your account information as necessary to ensure its accuracy.

      The content included on your individual profile should be relevant to the intended use of our Services. You may
      not display any personal contact or banking information, whether in relation to you or any other person (for
      example, names, home addresses or postcodes, telephone numbers, email addresses, URLs, credit/debit card or other
      banking details). If you choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, you do so at
      your own risk. We encourage you to use caution in disclosing any personal information online.

      Your individual profile will be visible to other people around the world, so be sure that you are comfortable
      sharing Your Content before you post. You acknowledge and agree that Your Content may be viewed by other users,
      and, notwithstanding these Terms, other users may share Your Content with third parties.

      You understand and agree that we may monitor or review Your Content, and we have the right to remove, delete,
      edit, limit, or block or prevent access to any of Your Content at any time in our sole discretion. Furthermore,
      you understand agree that we have no obligation to display or review Your Content.

      is stored on our servers and displayed at the direction of that user.

      You do not have any rights in relation to Member Content, and you may only use Member Content to the extent that
      your use is consistent with our Services’ purpose of allowing use to communicate with and meet one another. You
      may not copy the Member Content or use Member Content for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make
      unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate your account if you misuse Member Content.

      purposes as intended by GroupDate and permitted by these Terms and applicable laws.

   </p>
   <strong>7. RIGHTS YOU GRANT GroupDate</strong>
   <p>
      You own all of the content you provide to GroupDate, but you also grant us the right to use Your Content as
      provided in this Agreement.

      By creating an account, you grant to GroupDate a worldwide, perpetual, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free
      right and license to host, store, use, copy, display, reproduce, adapt, edit, publish, translate, modify, and
      distribute Your Content, including any information you authorize us to access from Facebook or other third-party
      source (if applicable), in whole or in part, and in any format or medium currently known or developed in the
      future. GroupDate’s license to Your Content shall be non-exclusive, except that GroupDate’s license shall be
      exclusive with respect to derivative works created through use of our Services. For example, GroupDate would have
      an exclusive license to screenshots of our Services that include Your Content.

      In addition, so that GroupDate can prevent the use of Your Content outside of our Services, you authorize
      GroupDate to act on your behalf with respect to infringing uses of Your Content taken from our Services by other
      users or third parties. This expressly includes the authority, but not the obligation, to send notices pursuant to
      17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3) (i.e., DMCA Takedown Notices) on your behalf if Your Content is taken and used by third
      parties outside of our Services. GroupDate is not obligated to take any action with regard to use of Your Content
      by other users or third parties. GroupDate’s license to Your Content is subject to your rights under applicable
      law (for example, laws regarding personal data protection to the extent the content contains personal information
      as defined by those laws).

      In consideration for GroupDate allowing you to use our Services, you agree that we, our affiliates, and our
      third-party partners may place advertising on our Services. By submitting suggestions or feedback to GroupDate
      regarding our Services, you agree that GroupDate may use and share such feedback for any purpose without
      compensating you.

      You agree that GroupDate may access, preserve, and disclose your account information, including Your Content, if
      required to do so by law or upon a good faith belief that such access, preservation, or disclosure is reasonably
      necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce these Terms; (iii) respond to claims that any content
      violates the rights of third parties; (iv) respond to your requests for customer service; or (v) protect the
      rights, property or personal safety of the Company or any other person.
   </p>
   <strong>8. ACCOUNT TERMINATION</strong>
   <p>
      If you no longer wish to use our Services, or if we terminate your account for any reason, here’s what you need to
      know.

      You can delete your account at any time by logging into the App, going to the options panel, pressing "Delete
      account" and following the instructions to disable or delete your account.
   </p>
   <strong>9. NO CRIMINAL BACKGROUND OR IDENTITY VERIFICATION CHECKS</strong>
   <p>

      AUTHORIZE GroupDate TO CONDUCT—ANY CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECK OR OTHER SCREENINGS (SUCH AS SEX OFFENDER REGISTER
      SEARCHES) AT ANY TIME USING AVAILABLE PUBLIC RECORDS, AND YOU AGREE THAT ANY INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE MAY BE USED
      FOR THAT PURPOSE. IF THE COMPANY DECIDES TO CONDUCT ANY SCREENING THROUGH A CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY, YOU HEREBY
      AUTHORIZE THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN AND USE A CONSUMER REPORT ABOUT YOU TO DETERMINE YOUR ELIGIBILITY UNDER THESE
      TERMS.

      YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS. SEX OFFENDER SCREENINGS AND OTHER TOOLS DO NOT
      GUARANTEE YOUR SAFETY AND ARE NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR FOLLOWING THE SAFETY TIPS AND OTHER SENSIBLE SAFETY
      PRECAUTIONS. ALWAYS USE YOUR BEST JUDGMENT AND TAKE APPROPRIATE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS WHEN COMMUNICATING WITH OR
      MEETING NEW PEOPLE. COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING AUTOMATIC NOTIFICATIONS SENT BY
      GroupDate, MAY RESULT FROM USERS ENGAGING WITH THE SERVICE FOR IMPROPER PURPOSES, INCLUDING FRAUD, ABUSE,
      HARASSMENT, OR OTHER SUCH IMPROPER BEHAVIOR.

      Though GroupDate strives to encourage a respectful user experience, it is not responsible for the conduct of any
      user on or off the Service. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other users, particularly if you
      decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person.
   </p>
   <strong>10. DISCLAIMER</strong>

      WILL BE ACCURATE. FURTHERMORE, GroupDate MAKES NO GUARANTEES AS TO THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE USERS AT ANY TIME; USERS’
      ABILITY OR DESIRE TO COMMUNICATE WITH OR MEET YOU, OR THE ULTIMATE COMPATIBILITY WITH OR CONDUCT BY USERS YOU MEET
      THROUGH THE SERVICES.

      GroupDate TAKES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY CONTENT THAT YOU OR ANOTHER USER OR THIRD PARTY POSTS, SENDS, OR
      RECEIVES THROUGH OUR SERVICES NOR DOES GroupDate TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE IDENTITY, INTENTIONS, LEGITIMACY,
