### Setting Up Gremlin Visualizer
To setup gremlin visualizer, you need to have `node.js` and `npm` installed in your system.

* Clone the project
```sh
git clone https://github.com/prabushitha/gremlin-visualizer.git
```
* Install dependencies
```sh
npm install
```
* Run the project
```sh
npm start
```
* Open the browser and navigate to
```sh
http://localhost:3000
```

Note - Frontend starts on port 3000 and simple Node.js server also starts on port 3001. If you need to change the ports, configure in `package.json`, `proxy-server.js`, `src/constants` 

#### Setting up with Docker

You can build a Docker image of the gremlin visualizer with the included `Dockerfile`.
This will use the current version of the `master` branch of the source GitHub repository.
The Docker image can be built by calling the `docker build` command, for example:

```sh
docker build --tag=gremlin-visualizer:latest .
```

The image can also be downloaded from Docker hub: [`prabushitha/gremlin-visualizer:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/r/prabushitha/gremlin-visualizer).

```sh
docker pull prabushitha/gremlin-visualizer:latest
```

The Docker image can then be run by calling `docker run` and exposing the necessary ports for communication. See [Docker's documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/) for more options on how to run the image.

```sh
# if you built the image yourself
docker run --rm -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 --name=gremlin-visualizer gremlin-visualizer:latest
# if you downloaded from Docker Hub
docker run --rm -d -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 --name=gremlin-visualizer prabushitha/gremlin-visualizer:latest
```

The Docker container can be stopped by calling `docker stop gremlin-visualizer`.

### Usage
* Start Gremlin-Visualizer as mentioned above
* Start or tunnel a gremlin server
* Specify the host and port of the gremlin server
* Write an gremlin query to retrieve a set of nodes (eg. `g.V()`)

### Features
* If you don't clear the graph and execute another gremlin query, results of previous query and new query will be merged and be shown.
* Node and edge properties are shown once you click on a node/edge
* Change the labels of nodes to any property
* View the set of queries executed to generate the graph
* Traverse in/out from the selected node
