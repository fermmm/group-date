# Current state of this project

This project was live and worked for more than 2000 users, but I removed the client from the stores because I could not promote the app and didn't want to pay the cost of having it live. Currently I'm working on a new client that will be more suitable for a wider kind of users. This means the client is a work in progress and the server is complete and fully functional.

This is the repo of the React Native client that is complete and fully functional but not currently live:
