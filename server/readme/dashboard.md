## Dashboard

This project contains an admin dashboard that you can use to do technical tasks, checks, inspect users activity and many things you will need to make sure the app is a good experience for the users.

When the server starts you will see a console message showing the dashboard url but some initial setup steps are needed to make it work.

### Setup dashboard

1. In the .env file there are some values to set:

   **ADMIN_USER**: Here you have to create a user name that will be used later, can be anything with more than 2 characters long.
   
   **ADMIN_PASSWORD**: Here you have to create a password, with a minimum of 6 characters.

That is all. Restart the server and browse the dashboard url and you should be able to login.
